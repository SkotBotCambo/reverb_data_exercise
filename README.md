# Data Exercise for Reverb.com Interview

The primary notebook for this exercise is [`Final Analyses.ipynb`](https://github.com/SkotBotCambo/reverb_data_exercise/blob/main/Final%20Analyses.ipynb).

## Environment:
To run this notebook on your local machine, I suggest using Python 3.7.7 (the version I used to create this) and install all relevant packages using `pipenv install` which will read the `Pipenv` file in the root directory of this repository. If you don't have pipenv installed, you can do so [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/).
